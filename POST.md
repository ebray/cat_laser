Understanding the developer ecosystem:

I am a furnituremaker by trade and a very young 5 years into all things technical.  As I broaden my view across what encompasses this vast ecosystem, I find myself jumping around, burrowing down into the weeds, and pouncing on any given particular concept or point...behavior I can only liken it to watching a cat chase a laser pointer.

And I'm sure it's just as amusing to anyone well versed in application developement and developer tooling.  

So be it.  As long as it takes, I guess.

Some notable moments in my discovery:
    "Wait, there are files on my mac that are hidden from me?  Wow.  So why are they all the most important ones?!?"
    
    "Man, I'm gonna look so cool at the coffee shop when someone looks over and sees I have Terminal and Atom PINNNED to my         dock."
    
    "Man, it be cooler if I knew how to use Terminal and Atom that are pinned to my dock."
    
    "FRIEND: Object oriented code is written for humans, not computers.  It has to be translated to binary for a computer to        understand.  
    ME: Who does that?  
    FRIEND: The computer.    
    ME: I thought you said it can't read code.
    FRIEND: It can't.  Don't worry about it.  Just know that code is for humans.
    ME: Sure, for humans.  I've never talked like that in my life.  This guy, with the 'for humans' shit."
    
    "I copied it exactly as it is; why doesn't it work?!? ....oh, wait.  Oh, that's...I see...So I just need to change....what      the F*%#K is camel case?"
    
    "Grunt exists? Grunt exists!"
    
    "I just wrote a goddam, working reg ex!!!  Now I can verify a phone number or birthday!!  That's so awesome, and so not         that awesome...really."  
    
    "So you're saying that I can actually write code to test my code...seems that would still include the single point of           failure...me."
